    <h1>Information about Kiara Munz</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Kiara Munz and I am a computer science major, minoring in imgd, and hoping to graduate in 2023! I have been a moderately avid coder since freshman year of highschool, so I have encountered a wide variety of code related things in my travels :) Outside of the coding world, I like neon colors, craft projects, and video games.
